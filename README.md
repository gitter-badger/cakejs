CakeJS is a NodeJS framework intended to be used either standalone, remote webserver 
or with CakePHP, This framework imitates CakePHP 3.x in many ways such as hierarchy,
MVC structure without view generation, naming convention, routing.

The purpose is to make it easy for CakePHP developers to recognize the workflow.

This is a work in progress and since it's in a early phase, features gets implemented on demand,
but our current goal is to support Model-Controller structure with low performance impact and make
projects scalable easy.
